# Description
PlatformIO project purposes a building firmware EPS32 Espressif Systems microcontroller firmware. Task is consisted to provide control by multichannel high-voltage power source presented by 16 independent resonant circuit. Each channel requires AC-voltage signal to meander amplitude control and square waveform signal to control its carrier frequency. To realize this the two DAC modules (LTC3636) routed by SPI interface and eight square waveform signal generators (SI5351) routed by multiplexed I2C interface (cascade of two TCA9548A with shifted address pins) are exploited. To avoid electromagnetic pickup and to improve device compactness the wireless communication is used by means a creation of Wi-Fi local Access Point by microcontroller.
