# Description
PlatformIO project purposes a building firmware EPS32 Espressif Systems microcontroller firmware. Task is consisted to provide control by multichannel high-voltage power source presented by 16 independent resonant circuit. Each channel requires AC-voltage signal to meander amplitude control and square waveform signal to control its carrier frequency. To realize this the two DAC modules (LTC3636) routed by SPI interface and eight square waveform signal generators (SI5351) routed by multiplexed I2C interface (cascade of two TCA9548A with shifted address pins) are exploited. To avoid electromagnetic pickup and to improve device compactness the wireless communication is used by means a creation of Wi-Fi local Access Point by microcontroller. Wireless transfer protocol of UDP is implemented by standard open-source libraries. Transferred packets are presented JSON notation like
```
	{'dac': {'index': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'value': [1000, 1100, 1200, 1300]}, 'fm': {'index': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'value': [45, 50, 55, 60]}}
```
where `'dac'` and `'fm'` designate a command to control of devices: DACs and frequency generators correspondingly; `'index'` and `'value'` are same size vector arbitrary length and present itself index of channel `0-15` and its value (voltage or frequency). Range of `'value'` for DACs consists `0-4000 [mV]` and frequency generators -- `0-160 [kHz]`.

UDP server is hosted by port `8080`, HTTP server - `8090`. Default IP-Address is `192.168.1.1`.
